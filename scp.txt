Secure Copy - "scp":

	Simple function that uses SSH (Secure Shell) to copy files between
	a remote location and a local location. File source can be either
	remote or local, and file destination can also be either remote or
	local. However, the destination and the source cannot both be remote
	simultaneously. See the use cases below for further explanation.

	Use Cases:

		A. Local --> Local
		B. Local --> Remote
		C. Remote --> Local
		D. NO - doesn't work: Remote --/--> Remote

	How to use:

		Pulling a file:

			scp [USER]@[SERVER_IP]:[PATH_TO_FILE] [FULL_DESTINATION_DIRECTORY_PATH]

		Pushing a file:

			scp [PATH_TO_FILE] [USER]@[SERVER_IP]:[FULL_DESTINATION_DIRECTORY_PATH]
